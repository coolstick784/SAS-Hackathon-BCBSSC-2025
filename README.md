# SAS-Hackathon-BCBSSC-2025

This repository hosts code and data for the "Predicting Services from Diagnoses" portion of our 2025 SAS Hackathon submission for BCBSSC. I used XGBClassifier with RandomizedSearchCV to create 10 different models to predict different services a member may need based on the diagnoses they have. I also utilized Association Rule Mining to define some relationships in plain English.
